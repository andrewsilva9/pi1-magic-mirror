## What is this?

This is a WordPress site that you can run locally on a Raspberry Pi to have it function as a Magic Mirror. You may need to make some changes to fit your TV / monitor well, as this is designed for a portrait-view TV that's 12 inches across.

You will first need to get apache running, but raspberrypi.org has a fantastic walkthrough for that available here: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/web-server/apache.md

After that, putting the WordPress site in place is pretty straightforward! You can see my finished product and read a brief overview at www.andrew-silva.com
